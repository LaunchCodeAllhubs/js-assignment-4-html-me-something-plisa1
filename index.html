         <h3>The Good Boy's Story</h3>
         <p>Peter is a very good boy who likes to sleep, yell, and eat. 
            Peter used to lived with dogs and learned the sit command with them. 
            He grew up with a brother who would eat his food until his new mom 
            brought him home and helped him gain a healthy weight. 
            Now he yells at 8am on the dot to be fed breakfast and 6:30pm for dinner. 
            Occassionally, he drools making biscuits. 
            He is also considered a tomcat because he was neutered later in life, 
            as not being neutered early caused him to have a big head and neck. Vets see his head in the carrier and say, 
            "Wow, he's going to be big!" and they pull him out and then say, "Where's the rest of his body?"
