         <h3>The Good Boy's Story</h3>
         <p>Peter is a very good boy who likes to sleep, cry, and eat. 
            Peter used to lived with dogs and learned the sit command while living with them. 
            He grew up with a brother who would eat his food until his new mom 
            brought him home and helped him gain a healthy weight. 
            Now, he yells at 8am on the dot to be fed breakfast and 6:30pm for dinner. 
            Occassionally, he drools making biscuits. 
            He is also considered a tomcat because he was neutered later in life, 
            as not being neutered early caused him to have a big head and neck. Vets see his head in the carrier and exclaim, 
            "Wow, he's a big boy!" As they proceed to pull him out, and to their surprise they disappointedly say, "Where's the rest of his body?"
